# [Cosmic 2.2]

Cosmic is a fork of the popular Rocket theme for Moodle. Cosmic was developed by Lafayette College ITS. The Rocket theme is maintained by Julian Ridden <https://github.com/moodleman/moodle-theme_rocket>.

Previous versions of Cosmic through 1.3 were child themes of Rocket. Starting from version 2.0 Cosmic is a content-fork of Rocket, although it is backwards compatible with older versions of Cosmic. It also been optimized to work on Moodle 2.4.

The included mod/scheduler icon was created by GNOME icon artists (GNOME SVN / GNOME FTP) [GPL (<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>)].
